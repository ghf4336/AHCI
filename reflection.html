    <h1>Adrian Liow 16952667 Reflection: </h1>
    <p>Doing this Usability study has taught me many things that I hope to take with me once I graduate. I am a final year Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences student majoring in 
        Computer Science and Software Development. In my time that I have spent in university, this is the first time I have done a proper usability study.<BR><BR>
        
            Working on this study alone has forced me to learn about everything to do with usability testing. Before doing this project I had a basic understanding of what a
            usability test is but never understood the importance of doing one. How the user interacts with a product or software is a huge aspect of how successful it will be. There
            is no point in making something that people cannot use or is hard to use. Being a software developer student I am always making products that ordinally people have to
            interact with. It can be so easy to get caught up with the looks and technical side of the software without thinking about the end-user. Sometimes when I am making an app 
            I think it is easy and simple to use but to a user, it can be tricky and confusing. Doing a usability test allows me as a developer to understand how the user interacts with
            the product and what can be done to improve their experience.  <BR><BR>

            When doing this project there were some things that did not go well. The first major thing was time management. I got the approval for this project a little later than expected
            this meant that I was not able to start my data collection early. Ideally, I wanted to give my participants about two weeks to complete the experiment. Due to timetable clashes
            and busy schedules, I found it hard to come up with a time to meet them and go over the experiment. I had to also physically meet each participant up to give them the app, instructions
            and survey. This meant that each participant had just over a week to complete 4 naps. Another issue was poor instructions. I forgot to tell the participants that if they try to
            take a nap and do not fall asleep then the nap session still counts towards the experiment. Although only one participant only ended up failing a nap. This issue could of heavily 
            influence the data if more people failed naps without recording it. <BR><BR>

            There were many things that went well in this project. Overall I am very happy with the work that I put in especially being a one-man group. I enjoyed doing the whole usability study
            by myself as it allowed me to be part of the whole process. From finding the study, planning, conducting experiments and doing the write-up, I was able to learn and experience
            all of it. The study as a whole went really well. I was able to collect useful data and analyze it. this allowed me to make a conclusion to my hypothesis as well as make 
            recommendation to the appropriate people. The data that I collected prove to be valuable to certain stakeholders, which is something that I am proud of.  <BR><BR>

            This study has given me the proper skills to take on a proper Usability test. I hope to learn from my mistakes next time I do something similar to this. I now understand the
            importance of conducting a usability test and the correct steps needed to do so.
