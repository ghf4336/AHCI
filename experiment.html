    <h1>Participants </h1>
    <p>Six people will be chosen to do this experiment. NapApp's target audience is at university students. Therefore this experiment will consists of 6 student participants . Each participant is
      required to have an android phone with a screen bigger than 4.5 inches. This is the minimum screen size needed for the app to be compatible with the phone. The participants that are
      picked will also have zero prior experience with using this app. About 60 minutes total is required to take this test. This is an estimated time as the overall time can be more or less 
      depending on the number of naps that are taken. A safe location should be picked when testing the app. As they will be sleeping with their phone beside them in an unsecure
      position. 
    </p>

    <h1>Equipment/Resources</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Android Phone with a screen 4.5 inches or bigger</li>
            <li>A safe location</li>
            <li>A pen</li>
            <li>Bed/Chair to sleep on</li>
          </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p> Each participant will have the NapApp installed on their phone along with a few copies of the same survey and instructions. They will be shown how to use the app as well 
      as have the opportunity
      to ask any questions before starting the experiment. Participants will be given 7 days to complete 4 naps. Each nap will
      require the participant to use a different vibration intensity, which can be changed easily through the app nap settings. There are four vibration settings participants must use, which are 
       1, 3, 6 and 8. Setting 1 is the lowest vibration intensity, with setting 8 being the highest. <BR><BR>
      When a nap is finished a short survey must be filled up. More details about the survey can be found below this page.
    </p>

    <h1>Experiment Controls</h1>
    <p>Since the testing will be done remotely, instructions will be given to the participants to make sure it is a fair and controlled experiment. Participants are encouraged to do the
       test in a quiet room where they will not be disturbed. They will also be asked to do it at the same time of the day if it is possible to do so. If the participant wakes up during a nap
       the test will still count since the experiment is on falling asleep not the sleep itself. If the participant does not fall asleep the test will still also count.

      <li>Set how long you want to nap for</li>
      <li>Set the vibrate setting to 1, 3, 6, 8 (note you should use each setting at least once out of your 4 naps</li> 
      <li>Start nap</li>
      <li>Tap on screen when you feel a vibration</li>
      <li>When you wake up click on "view summary" button</li>
      <li>Now fill in the survey provided</li>
