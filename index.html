    <h1>About NapApp</h1>
    <p>NapApp is an android mobile application built by AUT students for the company LifeSpan Trust. The purpose of the application is to allow users to take a timed nap based on when they 
      start to fall asleep. When the user falls asleep a timer is set to the amount of time they want to sleep for and an alarm will ring at the end to wake them up. NapApp is currently in 
      development as a Research and Development Project. 
    </p>

    <h1>Sleep Detection</h1>
    <p>Sleep detection is the method in which the app recognizes that the user has fallen asleep. NapApp uses a tap detection method as its sleep detection. When the participants are trying 
       fall asleep. The phone will vibrate every 10 seconds. Each vibration requires the user to tap on the screen to notify the app that they are still awake. When the user misses 3 taps the 
        timer for the nap starts, hence they have fallen asleep.
    </p>

    <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
    <p> Is a vibration with a higher intensity is more likely to keep the user awake when using the app?<BR>
      We believe the higher the vibration intensity the more likely the user will stay awake. This statement is made based on past experiences we have had with the app. We hope to prove or
       disprove this hypothesis based on the test that we do.  
    </p>

    <h1>Usability Test Summary</h1>
    <p> This usability test will be done by Adrian Liow from Auckland University of Technology. This test will be done as an assignment for the Bachelor of Computer and Information Science paper,
      Applied Human Computer Interaction (COMP719) paper. The usability test will be testing the hypothesis stated above with 6 participants.<BR><BR>

      Each participant will have to take the test individually and independently over the course of one week. They are expected to complete a survey everytime they take a nap, which will be given  
      to them when they get the app installed onto their phone.<BR><BR>

      Based on the results given from each participant, an analysis will be done to come up with some findings for the hypothesis. The findings will be made available to the appropriate stakeholders.
