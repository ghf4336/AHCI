    <h1>Conclusion and Recommendations:</h1>
    <p>The main objective of this usability study was to test to see if a higher vibration intensity would affect a user from falling asleep using the NapApp. From our findings that was conducted
        from the experiments with 6 participants. We were able to analyze the data to come to a conclusion about the hypothesis. Recommendations will also be made to the NapApp's development team
        as to what the app could benefit from based on this usability study. Recommendations will also be made to future NapApp users on how to use the app well.  
    </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>From our findings and analysis, we can conclude that a balanced vibration workes best for most people. We found that a soft vibration will cause miss taps and a hard 
        vibration will keep the user awake. Having a good well-balanced vibration will allow people to use the app more easily and effectively. Based on the experiment we are also able to
        see that not everyone responds the same way to each vibration setting. As some people may prefer using a heavy vibration like setting 8 compared to a lower vibration like 1 or 3.
    </p>
   
    <h1>Recommendations to the user</h1>
    <p>Based on the feedback from the participants here are some recommendations when using the app:
            <ul>
                    <li>When picking a vibration setting try all of them, to find which setting works best for you</li>
                    <li>When picking a vibration setting consider the type of surface your phone is going to be resting on. Hard surfaces usually cause bigger and louder vibrations</li>
                    <li>Try not to worry to much on missing a vibration as you have to miss 3 in a row to trigger the timer</li>
                    <li>Try to focus on sleeping rather than then vibration. As this will help you go to sleep faster</li>
                  </ul> 
    </p>

    <h1>Recommendations to the NapApp Developers</h1>
    <p>Based on the feedback from the participants here are some recommendations that can be change/implemented in future versions:
            <ul>
                    <li>Currently there are 8 different vibration settings. Consider narrowing it down to 4-5 setting in increments of 2 levels. Since going up or down one level 
                        does not make a big difference.</li>
                    <li>Tips and tricks on how to use the app may greatly benefit the user.</li>
                    <li>Currently users have to remember what settings they use because the app does not remember it.</li>
                    
                  </ul> 
    </p>
