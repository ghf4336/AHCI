    <H1>Things we considered before analyzing the data:</H1>  

    <p>The analysis made in this report is based on the 6 participants that completed the full experiment. Due to limited time and resources, we hoped to have more people do the experiment to 
        better reflect the population. We also considered the fact that people sleep differently. How humans sleep is very dependent on their body and their sleep habits/lifestyle. This will 
        obviously have an effect on the data as everyone sleeps differently. The feel of the vibratons may also differ from participant to participant. For example, a vibration will feel
        different when on a hard surface like a desk compared to a soft surface like a bed. With all these things considered here is the analysis below.    
         </p>

    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <p>From the data that was collected from every participant, we can check if our hypothesis is a valid statement. We are wanting to know if a vibration with a
       higher intensity is more likely to keep the user awake when using the app? Below we will explain what we found and how that relates to this hypothesis. 
    </p>
   
    <p>With the findings that we have, we were able to identify patterns that were found among our participants. In Figure 1 we can see that vibration setting 8 and 1 had the highest average
        time to fall asleep. Based on our hypothesis we were expecting setting 8 to be the longest time but we did not expect setting 1 to have the second-longest time. After finding
        these results we asked each participant  why they taught setting 1 stopped them from falling asleep faster. The majority of the participants said it is because the vibration intensity
        was too soft. Therefore they had to focus on the vibration itself in order not to miss vibrations. Setting 8 gave us the results that we were expecting. Because 8 has to most 
        "aggressive" vibration. It sometimes kept the participants awake due to the vibrations haptic feedback and loud sounds caused by the vibration. Due to the large haptic feedback from 
        setting 8, missed taps were almost nonexistent. Not missing any taps came at the cost of taking longer to fall asleep. The vibration with the best result was vibration 3 followed by 6.
        Based on the results of vibration 1 and 8 it now makes sense as to why 3 and 6 had the best results. The factor of being intense enough to feel the vibration while trying not to
        keep the participant awake is crucial to when they fall asleep. Vibration settings 3 and 6 both somewhat have this balance which is why they performed the best. A graphical  
        representation can be found of this in Figure 2. 
    </p>

    <p>Missed taps are an important factor to consider when using this app. Missing 3 taps in a row will cause the nap timer to start. So it is important users tap when they are still
         awake. In Figure 4 we see that 2 out of 6 people missed one or more taps when on vibration 1. When the vibration was set to low participants found they had to focus more on
        the vibration itself and not on sleep. This became increasingly more difficult when they were about to doze off as their intention to the vibration would be lower.  
    </p>

    <p>Having a heavy vibration setting like setting 8 also clearly had an impact on the participant's ability to get to sleep. Due to some misunderstood instructions participants who did 
       not fall asleep when testing the app did not count that as a nap. To compensate for this incomplete data each participant was asked if there were any naps that they did not complete.
       Only one participant replied saying they could not fall asleep during when of their naps when the vibration setting was on 8. Almost every participant also came to the conclusion
       that is was very distracting to have the vibration on 8. This was because of the intense vibration and the increased sound caused by the vibration.  <BR><BR> <BR>
